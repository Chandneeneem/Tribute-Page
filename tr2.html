                ☛ Retirement from captaincy across all formats<br><br>
                ☛In September 2021, Kohli announced that he would step down as India's T20I captain following the 2021 ICC Men's T20
                 World Cup .
                <br><br>
                ☛In December 2021, Kohli was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain. BCCI President Sourav Ganguly later
                explained the decision to drop Kohli as ODI captain by saying that the selectors did not feel right to have two white 
                ball captains.Later Ganguly said that BCCI had told Virat to not step down as T20I captain. Virat Kohli, during a
                press conference, contradicted the BCCI President and said that his decision of stepping down as captain was "received 
                well" and termed as "progressive" by the BCCI officials. He also claimed that chief selector Chetan Sharma 
                informed him 90-minutes before the announcement of the Test squad for India's tour of South Africa, about the removal 
                from ODI captaincy.More than a week later, during the announcement of squad for ODI series versus South Africa, Chetan
                Sharma contradicted Kohli by saying that officials had asked Virat to reconsider his decision of stepping down as T20I
                captain.<br><br>

                ☛On 15 January 2022, Kohli stepped down as India's Test captain, following the 2–1 test series defeat against South
                 Africa during the tour of South Africa.<br><br>
