                ☛In 2002, he played for Delhi Under-15 team and became the leading run-getter in the 2002–03 Polly 
                Umrigar Trophy tournament. He was made the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy.<BR><br>
                ☛He was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. He scored 470
                runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds. He repeated his fabulous performance
                the next season too, and helped Delhi lift the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy.<br><br>
                ☛His consistent performances earned him a place in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England in 
                2006. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series which the India Under-19 squad won. He also performed
                remarkably against Pakistan’s U-19 cricket team later that year.<br><br>
                ☛His father died in 2006 when Kohli was just 18. His father had been his biggest support and his untimely
                death plunged the family into a financial crisis. With more responsibilities on his young shoulders now, Kohli 
                 began taking the game even more seriously.<br><br>
                ☛In 2008, he led the Indian team to victory at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. 
                Following this, he was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise, Royal Challengers Bangalore, for
                 $30,000 on a youth contract.<br><br>
                ☛He was selected for the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka in 2008. During the tour, he batted as a 
                makeshift opener throughout the series as both the regular openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag
                were injured. India eventually won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri
                Lanka in Sri Lanka.<br><br>
                ☛He continued performing consistently throughout 2009. He received his first man of the match award after 
                scoring an unbeaten 79 against the West Indies in a group match during the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Later
                the same year he played in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka, scoring his first ODI century—107 off 111
                balls—in the fourth match of the series.<br><br>
                ☛He continued with his good form which earned him a place in the 2011 World Cup squad. Kohli played in every
                match in the tournament and scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh, becoming the first
                Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut. India reached the finals, and Kohli scored important 
                35 runs in the finals against Sri Lanka. India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World
                Cup for the first time since 1983.<br><br>
                ☛During the India tour of West Indies in June–July 2011, India sent a largely inexperienced squad and Kohli
                was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad. He made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match 
                of the Test series. India won the Test series 1–0 but Kohli was found wanting against the fast bowling. 
                He scored just 76 runs from five innings in the series and was subsequently dropped from the Test squad.<br><br>
                ☛He was recalled to Test squad ndia's four-match series in England in July and August 2011, as as replacement 
                for the injured Yuvraj Singh. He did not play in any Test match in the series and was moderately 
                successful in the ODI series.<br><br>
                ☛He made his mark in the Test cricket during the India's tour of Australia in December 2011. India
                lost the Test series 4–0 but Virat Kohli was India's top run-scorer in the series. He scored his maiden
                Test century in the first innings of fourth and final match at Adelaide; he scored 116 runs in the
                innings.<br><br>
                ☛Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh. In the final group stage
                match against Pakistan he scored 183 whilst chasing—the highest individual score against Pakistan
                in ODIs—and broke West Indies’ Brian Lara’s long standing record of 156. Despite his great
                performances India could not progress to the final of the tournament.<br><br>
                ☛His string of successful stints continued throughout 2013. He played well in the seven-match ODI 
                series against Australia, striking the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at
                Jaipur by blasting a 100 off just 52 balls. His innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the
                target of 360.<br><br>
                ☛Even though better known for his blazing performances in ODIs, Kohli is also a skilled test player. 
                In 2014, he was named the captain of the Indian test squad. In the Australian tour the same year,
                he amassed a total of 692 runs in four Tests—the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in 
                Australia.<br><br>
                ☛His career saw a temporary slump in 2015 when he was unable to make any big scores. However,
                he soon regained his form and became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in 
                T20I cricket during the South Africa's tour of India later the same year.<br><br>
                ☛Kohli was in terrific form in 2016. His superlative batting performances helped India reach
                the semifinals of 2016 T20 World Cup, held in India.<br><br>
                ☛In 2017, Virat scored 2818 runs in international matches, the third-highest tally ever in 
                a calendar year and the highest ever by an Indian cricketer. He was named as captain of World 
                Test XI and ODI XI for 2017 by the ICC.<br><br>
                
                ☛In the 5-match test series against England in 2018, Kohli scored 593 runs, the third highest
                total by an Indian batsman in a losing test series. The British Media as hailed his batting 
                as one of his finest. The Guardian described Kohli's batting display as One of the Greatest
                batting display in a losing cause. That same year, Kohli became the fastet player to score
                10,000 ODI runs; he took 205 innings to achieve the feat.<br><br>
                
                ☛In September 2021, Kohli resigned from the position of India's T20I captain, and in December 
                2021, he was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain. Following the 2–1 test series
                 loss to South Africa, Kohli stepped down as India's Test captain, on January 15, 2022.<br><br>
